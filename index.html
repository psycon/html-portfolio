    <h1><i>PsYcN's Portfolio</i></h1>
    <h2>These are my first steps as a web developer/software engineer. <br/>
        I am also a musician-more likely guitarist playing heavy THALL jams ripping heads apart, <br/>
        mixing/mastering engineer, because bands today are straight sci-fi utopia everyone knows <br/>
        that, so someone needs to add those blastbeats and knock some bridge cables (this is the <br/> 
        bass-guitar) and at some point we need to develop some vocal-scream plugin in order to <br/>
        distinguise the need of any real/human element in the music production so robots can take <br/>
        our place entirely, in that domain.I am also an electrical engineer (rofl), just don't <br/>
        call me to fix your shit, i don't wanna go in jail...yet.
